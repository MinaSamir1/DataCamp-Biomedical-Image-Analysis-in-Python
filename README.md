# DataCamp-Biomedical-Image-Analysis-in-Python
Discussing and Implementing Biomedical Image Analysis in Python From DataCamp skills track in more depth.



# Introduction

The field of biomedical imaging has exploded in recent years - but for the uninitiated, even loading data can be a challenge! I'll implement the fundamentals of image analysis using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. I'll navigate through a whole-body CT scan, segment a cardiac MRI time series, and determine whether Alzheimerâ€™s disease changes brain structure.


# Data

We Will use Medical data Like X-rays, Ct Scan and MRI

## for the Sunnybrook Cardiac

This dataset is drawn from the [Sunnybrook Cardiac Atlas Project](http://www.cardiacatlas.org/studies/sunnybrook-cardiac-data/). It has been de-identified and used as training data in a number of different competitions. This particular subject is a 27-year old male and was diagnosed with "heart failure without infarct". It may be found in the dataset under the ID of SCD0002001, as well as SC-HF-NI-15.  The series description for the included scans was: 1.528_???_-x_-y_256_256_???. They have been modified slightly from the original.
